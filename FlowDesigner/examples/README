There are 4 examples here:

hello.n     (displays "Hello World" as the output)
tone.n      (plays a "pseudo-sinewave" to the soundcard)
play_mp3.n  (plays an MP3 file to the soundcard)
find_beat.n (uses autocorrelation to find out the tempo in an MP3 song)

note that for the last two ones, you will need to click on "Parameters" to set
the name of your MP3 file
