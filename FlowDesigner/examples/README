There are 8 examples here:

hello.n     (displays "Hello World" as the output)
tone.n      (plays a "pseudo-sinewave" to the soundcard)
play_mp3.n  (plays an MP3 file to the soundcard)
find_beat.n (uses autocorrelation to find out the tempo in an MP3 song)
demo_feedback.n (demonstrates the use of feedback loops)
demo_if.n   (demonstrates the use of the "if" node)
helium.n    (plays a "helium-effect" of my (Jean-Marc) voice)
mixedthread.n (demonstrates the new thread capabilities - still a bit buggy)

NOTE: For play_mp3.n find_beat.n and mixedthread.n, you will need to click on 
"Parameters" to set the name of your MP3 file
