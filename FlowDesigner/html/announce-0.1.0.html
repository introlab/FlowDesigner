We are proud to announce the first release of the <a href="http://freespeech.on.openprojects.net/overflow.html">Overflow</a>
project, version 0.1. Overflow is a free (GPL) "data flow oriented" development
environment which allows to build programs by visually connecting simple
building blocks. Though it is primarily designed as a research tool, it
can also be used for real-time data processing. This first release includes
5 toolboxes: signal processing, image processing, speech recognition, vector
quantization and neural networks.
<p>The visual interface is written for GNOME, but there is also a command-line
tool that doesn't use GNOME. Because of the modular design, we hope to
have a KDE version in the future. Screenshots can be found <a href="http://freespeech.on.openprojects.net/FreeSpeech/html/Overflow/screenshots.html">here</a>.
