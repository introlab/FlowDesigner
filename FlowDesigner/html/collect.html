The Open Mind Speech project is asking for volunteers. Unlike most open
source projects, almost anyone can contribute to Open Mind projects. You
don't have to know how to program and it only takes a couple minutes of
your time.
<p>Open Mind Speech is part of the Open Mind Initiative and aims to develop
free (GPL) speech processing tools and applications, as well as collect
speech data from "e-citizens" using the Internet. This is the part where
we need your help. Most avdances speech processing algorithms need to be
trained with real speech data; a lot of data. The more data, the better
the system.
<p>Unfortunatly, most of the current speech databases are not freely available.
This situation slows down development of Open Source speech tools and research
in general. This is also why we need your help.
<h1>
Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>
How will the collected data be useful?</h3>
The data can be used for many applications. Even before it is transcribed,
it can be used for training speaker verification/identification and language
identification systems. It can also be used for testing speech processing
systems, like codecs and speech enhancement (de-noising, bandwitdh extension,
...) systems.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
What about privacy?</h3>
This collect is totally anonymous. We do not ask you to identify yourself.
And unlike what you see in movies, speaker identification systems are still
very far from being able to identify one voice out of millions of others
;-) So don't be afraid of that.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
How will the data be made available?</h3>
Depending on the amount of data we have, it will either be downloadable
from the anonymous ftp site, mirrored on another site, or available on
CDROM for no more than the cost of media+shipping.
<h3>
Under what license will the data be available?</h3>
The exact term is yet to be determined. However, it will be Free (as in
<i>free speech</i>, and possible as in <i>free beer</i>). We might also
include a privacy clause forbiding the use of the data for tracing back
information about participants.
