             *** Added features ***<br>
             - Now able to create notes (GUINotes) in the user interface. Notes can be added anywhere in any Network like post-it notes. Still need some work, but working properly. Notes can be moved anywhere, but they do not always appear at the good position when creating them.
            <br>
            - Now able to import / export already existing networks. Next step is to have the ability to modify imported networks directly.
            <br>
             
            
            <br>
            *** Fixed features ****
            <br>
            - Now display the network type (iterator, subnet) properly in the Network tab(s)
            <br>
            - Node Parameters dialog working properly. Still need to bring back focus when dialog is minimized.
            <br>
            <br>
            *** Help Needed ***
            <br>
            - We need help to continue our Octave toolkit. Maybe you can contribute?
            <br>
            - We need help to create RPM and deb packages for the most popular Linux distributions. Please contact us if you have made RPMs and / or Debian packages so we can make them available for everybody.

	Please see <a href="download.html">download section</a> to download sources or binaries. This release includes
	new URL streams that can be specified by users at run time by using : tcp:host:port, file:filename, etc.
	Added automatic type conversion when using RCPtr<T> = ObjectRef. Fixed parameters passing at run-time from 
	document parameters. Now working with <a href="http://marie.sourceforge.net">MARIE</a>. Fixed String serialization. Added 
	Vector conversion with toInt, toFloat nodes. Removed ownership on sockets, which causes exceptions on 
	some systems. Work around what seems to be gnome header bugs. Reordered #include"s so that gnome.h 
	gets included after other headers. Octave plugin now parses octave file and executes properly, still 
	need more work on this toolbox. Added a lot of operators on basic types : add, sub, mul, div, concat.
