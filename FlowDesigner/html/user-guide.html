<h2>
Getting started with <i>vflow</i></h2>
If called with no argument, the <i>vflow</i> program will start with a
new empty Overflow document. It will already have a network named "MAIN".
It is important that every "program" contain a network called "MAIN", which
is equivalent to the main() function in a C program. You can add more sub-networks
(equivalent of sub-routines) from the menu "Networks->Add Network".
<p>You can then add nodes to your network by clicking on the right button
in the background, select "New Node" and the type of node you want. The
node inputs are displayed as a dot on the left side of each node, while
the outputs are displayed on the right side. Inputs and outputs are called
<i>terminals</i>. You can connect two nodes by clicking on a terminal and
dragging the mouse to another terminal. Note that you cannot connect two
outputs together, nor can you connect two inputs together. Except by using
the Feedback node ("advanced" feature), you should not have feedback loops
in your network. Links can be deleted by clicking on them with the SHIFT
modifier on.
<p>Right-clicking on a node brings up the node menu. Selecting "Properties"
in the node menu brings a dialog with parameters used by the node. Each
parameter has a name a type and a value. Some of the parameters are mandatory,
while some others are optional. See the <a href="nodes.html">node documentation</a>
for a description of all the parameters.
<p>All networks must have at least one output. Any network that is not
a toplevel network (MAIN) may also have inputs. Inputs and outputs can
be added by left clicking on a terminal with the SHIFT modifier on. You
will be asked to provide the input/output name.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Using sub-networks (subnets) and iterators</h2>
In order to simplify programming, you can create sub-networks (main menu
Network->Add network) that can contain several nodes connected together.
That way, you can reuse those networks as subnets in a higher level network.&nbsp;
It is very important to name the newly created network a different name
than "MAIN" for obvious reasons.&nbsp; Those networks must absolutely have
"named" inputs and outputs in order to be used in higher level networks
as explained in the previous section.
<p>Another useful type of network you can create is the Iterator (main
menu Network->Add iterator). An iterator, is a control structure that performs
a loop. It stops looping when a certain "control condition" is met. The
condition is a boolean value the iterator gets from a node. To define the
iterator's condition, left click on a node output while holding the CONTROL
(or ALT) modifier. Note that there is a bug in some versions of gnome for
which CONTROL does not work with the canvas, so you'll have to use ALT.
<p>For now, Threaded Iterators are experimental. You should not use them,
unless you REALLY know what you are doing.
<h2>
Executing a program</h2>
When your program is complete, you can execute it by clicking "Run" in
the toolbar. If an error occurs, the program will abort and the error will
be printed in the text box in the bottom pane. Node that as of 0.6.0, the
created documents have execute permission and can be executed as a like
a script, provided that the batchflow executable is in the path.
<h2>
Automatic code generation</h2>
Is is now possible to generate C++ code from an Overflow .n file. You can
do that by clicking the "Build" button on the toolbar. Doing so brings
up the following dialog:
<center><img SRC="codegen.gif" height=257 width=408></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The "Build function name" is the name given to the function that will
return the network (<tt>Network *</tt>) corresponding to the XML file.
You will only care if you want to build a library or if you want multiple
networks. The "Output file name" option specifies the name of the C++ file
that builds the network. Of course, "Directory" specifies where to put
all that.
<p>There are 3 code generation options:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Generate main:</b> Check that if you want to build an application (as
opposed to a library)</li>

<li>
<b>Static linkage:</b> This will copy all the required Overflow files in
the same directory. This will allow to build an application/library without
linking to Overflow. Note that the Overflow license (LGPL) still applies
to the copied files.</li>

<li>
<b>Generate makefile:</b> Un-implemented yet</li>
</ul>
Note: the VFLOW_SOURCE environment variable must be set to your Overflow
source directory in order for the "static linkage" option to work.
