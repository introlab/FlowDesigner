Compiling &amp; Installing</h1></center>

<h2>
What you need</h2>

<ul>
<li>
an ANSI C++ compiler</li>

<ul>
<li>
gcc 2.95.x is OK</li>

<li>
most of gcc 2.96 variants are OK</li>

<li>
gcc 3.0.x should work (maybe some modifs required)</li>

<li>
egcs 1.1.2 is untested (probably doesn't work)</li>

<li>
MSVC++ is completely broken, but it possible build a subset of Overflow
with it (see <a href="compiling.html#WIN32">here</a>)</li>

<li>
HP's aCC should work after some modifications</li>
</ul>

<li>
autoconf, automake, libtool (which require perl and m4)</li>

<li>
GNU make</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</a> (now optional, but recommended)
compiled with --enable-float</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.gnome.org">gnome</a> (including the development libraries
and libxml)</li>

<br>pthreads (now included in most distributions)</ul>

<h2>
Installing the software</h2>
First read the <a href="download.html">Download </a>section.
<p>To compile, type:
<p>% ./configure --disable-static --prefix=&lt;your install directory>
<br>% make
<br>% make install
<p>Notes:
<ul>
<li>
As of version 0.5.1, it is now recommended to set the install <i>prefix</i>
to /usr or /usr/local, unless you want to keep more than one version installed
at the same time.</li>

<li>
If you are using a CVS tarball, you need to use ./autogen.sh instead of
./configure</li>

<li>
You might also need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to &lt;overflow prefix>/lib</li>
</ul>

<p><br>You can now start the Overflow environment by typing :
<br>% vflow
<p>(assuming &lt;overflow prefix>/bin is in your path)
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Configure options</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>-with-libtool-ld=&lt;</tt><i>c++ compiler</i><tt>></tt>&nbsp; You need
to specify this option if libtool tries to use ld to link the C++ libraries
and executables. These need to be linked with the C++ compiler (e.g. g++)
because of initializations that must be performed before the main() starts
(On linux you most likely don't need that).</li>

<li>
<tt>--with-fftw-dir=&lt;</tt><i>fftw path</i><tt>></tt>&nbsp; If FFTW is
not installed in a standard path, you will need to specify this option.</li>

<li>
<tt>--disable-static</tt>&nbsp; This option is required. Overflow does
not work with static libraries (because it uses <i>dlopen</i>).</li>

<li>
<tt>--disable-</tt><i>package&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Doesn't build a certain package
(e.g. HMM, VQ, ...)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="WIN32"></a>Compiling on Win32</h2>
Some parts of Overflow (sorry, no GUI yet!) have been ported to Win32 (w/
MSVC++). Using the code generation feature (the "Build" button on the toolbar),
it is now possible to compile an overflow application on Windows. Note
that this has not been fully tested yet.
<p>One important thing to note with MSVC++ is that it is a very buggy compiler,
mostly when it comes to templates. For example it does not support template
partial specialization and it chokes on a lot of valid template code (static
template member functions, pointer to template functions, ...). For this
reasons some Overflow features need to be switched off.
<p>So here are the settings you need for Overflow. First, you need to turn
on RTTI (which is not enabled be default). Also, I suggest you turn the
warnings off. The preprocessor flags (define) you need to set are: <tt>BROKEN_TEMPLATES,
HAVE_FLOAT_H, NO_HASH_MAP, STUPID_COMPLEX_KLUDGE </tt>and (if not already
defined), <tt>WIN32</tt>.
<h2>
Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>
<font size=+0>1) The binary distribution I downloaded crashes on startup</font></h3>
<font size=+0>There can be many causes of that. The most common is that
you have a different libstdc++ than the one Overflow was compiled with.
Another cause could be that you have FFTW compiled without --enable-float,
while Overflow was linked with a float version of FFTW. Overflow has no
way to detect that so it crashes. In both cases, the best thing to do is
to build Overflow yourself.</font>
<h3>
<font size=+0>2) Overflow tells me it cannot find libflow.so</font></h3>
<font size=+0>This can happen if you compile Overflow and then move the
installation directory (I can sometimes happen for other reasons). You
can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to &lt;overflow install dir>/lib. Note that
if you moved the Overflow directory, you'll also need to set VFLOW_HOME.</font>
<h3>
<font size=+0>3) The "New Node" menu is empty</font></h3>
<font size=+0>You probably moved the Overflow install directory, see 2)</font>
<h3>
<font size=+0>4) Overflow doesn't compile on my box</font></h3>
<font size=+0>First, make sure you have the latest release version. If
it doesn't work, you should try the CVS version. If it fails too, please
contact us and we'll do our best to make Overflow compile on your platforms.</font>
<h3>
<font size=+0>5) I downloaded a more recent version and it doesn't even
compile</font></h3>
<font size=+0>This can be due to the fact that you installed an earlier
version in a path like /usr or /usr/local. The problem is that the old
Overflow includes ended up somewhere like /usr/include and when you try
compiling a newer version, g++ sees the old includes (because they are
in the include path) instead of the new ones.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>UPDATED 2001/08/15:</b> As of 0.5.1, it is now safe
(and recommended) to install with /usr or /usr/local set as prefix.</font>
