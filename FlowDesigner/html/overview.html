<h1>
Overflow (Piper PL) versus Matlab/C</h1></center>

<h2>
Nodes</h2>
The basic processing using in Overflow is a Node, a Node is in all ways
similar to a C or Matlab function. It takes some input data, performs some
operations and send data out.
<blockquote>
<h3>
Built-in nodes</h3>
A built-in Overflow node is written in C++ and is part of the Overflow
code (or compiled in an Overflow toolbox, like Matlab's mex files). In
Overflow, all nodes are implemented as a class that derive (directly or
indirectly) from a base class called "Node" (note that most nodes derive
from "BufferedNode"). Although the Overflow implementation of different
nodes uses C++ inheritance mechanism (using classes), there's no reason
for the user to be aware of that. For that reason, it's not recommended
to refer to nodes as "types" (e.g.. if Overflow were written in C, nodes
would be implemented as functions).
<h3>
Subnets (composite nodes)</h3>
An Overflow subnet is a collection of connected nodes that can be used
as if it were a single node. Most Overflow subnets will be saved into .n
files, which are almost the exact equivalent of Matlab's .m files. There's
no real C equivalent because C is a compiled language (although it could
be seen as a C function calling other C function).
<h3>
Node inputs/outputs</h3>
The inputs of an Overflow nodes are equivalent to the arguments to a Matlab/C
function. The same for outputs, while C is restricted to one return value,
Overflow and Matlab can have several outputs.
<h3>
Node parameters</h3>
Overflow node parameters are also equivalent to C/Matlab function arguments.
The difference between node parameters and node inputs is that the parameters
cannot change at run-time. It is chosen at "build-time" and stays constant
throughout the run. For instance, the "Constant" node has no input, but
has a parameter called "VALUE" that is returned as the output of the node.
Using constants, you can always "transform" another node's input into a
parameter. The reverse is not true, however. Why then have parameters and
not define every argument as an input? Simplicity and run-time performances.
Sometimes, it's just a lot easier to know certain arguments in advance
and be sure that they don't change during the run. However, when possible,
it is better to implement arguments as inputs, as this allows more flexibility.</blockquote>

<h2>
Data Types</h2>
Unlike Matlab, that only supports the complex-double-matrix type (well,
that's not totally true, but...), Overflow (like C and C++) has support
for many different types. The basic Overflow types are: Bool, Int, Float,
Double, Stream and Vector. There are also toolbox-specific types, like
FFNet (neural network), VQ (Vector Quantizer), GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model),
...
<p>Right now, the only way to define a new type in Overflow is by adding
C++ code for it in a toolbox (or the core). Eventually, there will (could?)
be a way to pack data in a "struct" using Overflow nodes, but this is not
implemented yet.
<p>Some Overflow Nodes expect a certain type of data as input/parameter
and will generate a run-time exception (which will abort execution) if
the wrong data type is used (e.g.. a Load node expects a Stream as input
and nothing else). Some nodes, like the NOP (no-op) node, can take any
type as input. Some node have more complex behaviour, like the Add node
that can add two floats, two Vectors of the same dimension, but cannot
add a Bool and a Vector.
<h2>
Links</h2>
There's no real correspondence between Overflow links and C or Matlab constructs.
The best analogy would be to say that Links represent the order of the
lines in a C/Matlab function. You also need to keep in mind that Overflow
a "pull method" in order to compute data. What does that mean? When you
run a network, the last node (output node) of the main network (called
"MAIN" -- how original) is asked for its output. In order to compute its
output, it needs to ask its input nodes for their output. That way everything
propagates from the end to the beginning recursively.
<p>Now, why going backwards like that? That's a bit long to explain. The
quick answer is "because". The longer answer involves faster handling of
dependencies, faster processing, buffer management and things like that.
