Overview</h1></center>
FreeSpeech is an attempt to provide free (GPL) speech recognition for Linux
(or other UN*X eventually). We want it to be as easy as possible to integrate
with applications,desktops (<a href="http://www.gnome.org">gnome</a> and
<a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a>) or GUI libraries. To achieve that,
it will be in the form of a server to which "speech aware" processes can
connect to get speech input. We want to use a model similar to the one
X is using (although I have to say I'm not very familiar with the internals).
In that way, it will also be available through a network.
<p>This project is very young, and we don't have much code so far (we're
far from something working). We'd like to get the foundations as soon as
possible to have basic functionnalities working so we can start the <i><a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">bazaar</a></i>.
