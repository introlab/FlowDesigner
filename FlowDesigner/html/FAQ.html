Frequently Asked Questions</h1></center>

<h2>
A) Compiling</h2>

<h3>
1- What do I need to compile?</h3>

<ul>
<li>
an ANSI C++ compiler</li>

<ul>
<li>
gcc 2.95.x is OK</li>

<li>
most of gcc 2.96 variants are OK</li>

<li>
gcc 3.0.x should work (maybe some modifs required)</li>

<li>
egcs 1.1.2 is untested (probably doesn't work)</li>
</ul>

<li>
autoconf, automake, libtool (which require perl and m4)</li>

<li>
GNU make</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</a> (now optional, but recommended)
compiled with --enable-float</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.gnome.org">gnome</a> (including the development libraries
and libxml)</li>

<li>
pthreads (now included in most distributions)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
2- I get an error about ios::~ios() being protected. What's the problem?</h3>
You're using an old version of Overflow. Download the latest version and
it'll work.
<h3>
3- What's the problem with FFTW?</h3>
The <a href="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</a> package must be installed in
order to build and use Overflow. It must be configured with --enable-float.
At least for now, DO NOT use the --enable-type-prefix option.
<p>UPDATED 2001/05/30: The CVS and snapshots and versions > 0.4.3 should
be able to deal with FFTW using either float or double. However, your FFTW
installation has to match your binary Overflow installation.
<h3>
4- I have FFTW installed, but I get an error message about (FFTW_REAL *)
not matching (float *). What do I do?</h3>
The most likely cause for this error is forgetting to compile FFTW with
the --enable-float option (the default for FFTW is FFTW_REAL==double, so
it doesn't match with float vectors).
<p>See 3)
<h3>
5- What about Redhat 7.0 and gcc 2.96(RH)?</h3>
There seem to be some bugs with the early gcc 2.96 versions. The compiled
shipped with RedHat 7.0 is broken and often generates bad code.
<h3>
6- What platform does it run on?</h3>
The main development platform is Linux. However, Overflow is known to run
on FreeBSD and Solaris (x86 at least) too. For most other UN*X, the port
should be easy. HP-UX is more tricky, but since an earlier version worked
on it, it probably wouldn't be that hard to make the code compile on HP-UX.
<h3>
7- Is there a MS Windows port?</h3>
Yes, but it's limited and still experimental. Details <a href="compiling.html#WIN32">here</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
B) License</h2>
Please not that this section tries to explain the license in plain english.
However, it may not be completly accurate. If in doubt about what you are
allowed to do with Overflow, please refer to the files COPYING and COPYING.LGPL
in the Overflow distribution.
<h3>
1- How much does it cost?</h3>
How much do you want to pay me for it :-) Overflow is Free (libre) software,
and is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a>
(the <i>Lesser General Public License</i>) license, which is an open-source
compliant license.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
2- What am I allowed to do with it?</h3>
What you can do with it is explained in the LGPL. This can be summarized
as this: you may <i>use</i> the software without restriction. You may <i>redistribute</i>
the software as you wish as long as you make the source code available
with the same license. You may modify the source code, once again, as long
as you release the source code for these modifications.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
3- What about plugins/toolbox?</h3>
You may distribute binary-only plugins/toolbox. However, if you need to
modify Overflow itself, you need to release the source code to these modifications.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
4- What about the Overflow "programs" (.n) I write?</h3>
There are no restrictions at all on distribution of Overflow programs.
However, if you think your .n program or subnet may be useful to others,
please post it on the mailing list so I can be included in future versions
of Overflow, or at least be made available to others.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
C) Development</h2>

<h3>
1- I think I found a bug. What should I do?</h3>
First, don't hit me ;-) You can either post it on the mailing list or submit
the bug <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=590&atid=100590">here</a>.
Note that Overflow is in heavy development and there are certainly some
bugs.
<h3>
2- What about patches</h3>
Same thing, the best is to post any patch to the mailing list.
<h3>
3- Is backward compatibility preserved from release to release?</h3>
Depends on what kind of compatibility. Overflow programs (.n) created with
older versions will most of time work with a newer version (or require
very minor modifications). Source compatibility for external (custom) toolboxes
and Piper is also preserved most of the time. However, binary compatibility
is most of the times NOT preserved from release to release. This may change
when we reach 1.0, but for now, don't count on it.
