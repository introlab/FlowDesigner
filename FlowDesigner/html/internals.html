<h2>
Nodes</h2>
A node is the smallest processing unit in Overflow. Once it has been initialized,
the only method it understands is <i>getOutput(int output_id, int count)</i>.
In other words, all you can do with it is to ask it for its output. One
obvious consequence of that is that all node must have at least one output,
but it can have more than one. A node can have any number of input, including
zero (examples of node with no inputs are constants and random generators).
<p>If a node requires input data in order to perform some calculations,
it will call <i>getOutput(...)</i> on its input node(s). Computation is
hence performed in a recursive manner until everything is calculated and
the last node returns its output. The <i>count</i> argument to the <i>getOutput(...)</i>
method is used when loops are involved. It specifies the number of the
iteration. Note that it is possible for a node to ask its inputs for a
different <i>count</i> that the one received. It is even possible to ask
for many different <i>count</i> values in a row.
<p>The <i>Node</i> class is an abstract class from which all types of nodes
must derive (directly or indirectly). Information on how to derive new
types of nodes is given in <a href="extend.html">Extending Overflow</a>.

<h2>
Networks</h2>
A network is a graph containing nodes that are linked together in order
to perform some operation and/or return a result. Most of the time, the
graph will be acyclic that is, it will not contain loops. It is now (as
of march 2001) possible to have feedback loops using the <i>FeedBack</i>
node, but this is a more advanced topic. One thing worth mentioning is
that the Network class derives directly from the Node class. This means
that any network can be used just as if it were a single Node. This makes
it possible to include networks in other networks. The included network
is often refered to as <i>sub-network</i>, or <i>subnet</i>.
<p>In order for a network to ba valid, it must meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>
It must have at least one output</li>

<li>
Every node it contains must have a connection to at least one of its output</li>

<li>
All node must have all their inputs connected</li>

<li>
A toplevel network may not have inputs</li>

<li>
There should be no loop (except by using a <i>FeedBack</i> node)</li>
</ul>
